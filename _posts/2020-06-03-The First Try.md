This is my first blog.
It has been 28 days since I left the campus and graduated formally. Things were terrible in this period and worries surround me every day. Job, learning, love and affection...the whole thing is a mess.
I endeavore to rouse myself from the passive state though I am not sure what can I do and what shoud I do every day. So I will start from writing down my ideas, mood and what I learn.
Don't be lazy. Be honest to myself.
